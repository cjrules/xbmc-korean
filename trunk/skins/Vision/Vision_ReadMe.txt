INTRODUCTION
=========================================================================================
Hey guys! So it's finally here :)
Keep in mind! This is a public BETA. Not everything will work. There will be bugs. 
There will be things you don't like. There will be things you want to improve.
The reason I am releasing this beta, is to get your feedback! So let me know everything 
you like, or don't like (Hopefully NOTHIN!). A week from this release I will be starting 
the new Themes :) Titanium & ProjectMayhemThree. Other themes will be worked on in my 
spare time, but Titanium & ProjectMayhemThree are my top priority :) So keep a lookout 
for these.

The skin supports

=========================================================================================
Icon Pack (DVD Posters):
http://putstuff.putfile.com/59797/4488843	
With the release of this beta comes a pack of DVD Posters! 500+ of them. I personally grabbed 
500+ posters: Changed its dimensions to fit into xbmc perfectly. I also edited all of them, I 
took away small fonts you wouldn’t be able to read (Like critic reviews), Quotes from Movie, 
Enlarged the Movie Title if necessary, etc.

Icon Pack (TV Episodes):
http://putstuff.putfile.com/59800/114516
Another Icon pack! This pack includes hundreds episode thumbnails to use with your TV Shows. 
The pack contains around 1,000 Episode Thumbnails from over 15 popular TV Shows. Every Season, 
Every Episode. All renamed correctly with season numbers, episode numbers & the full-correct 
episode name ?. If you plan on using these thumbs Vision, make sure you have your ‘TV Shows’ in 
Wide Icon View, and your ‘Episodes’ in View2 (Movie Poster View)… Because they look slick with 
these settings :D

This is just the beginning of these packs. I will be creating icon packs for a lot more TV Shows 
(Next will be ALL 18 Seasons of The Simpsons, Friends, etc). I will be releasing a DVD Poster pack 
with 1,000+ DVD Posters. So check back in this thread for more information.
